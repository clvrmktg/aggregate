Abaco Aggregate is proud to support the Ministry of Works and Family Island Affairs in the ongoing road paving initiative in Central Pines, Abaco. This project aims to significantly enhance road conditions and improve overall driving safety for residents and visitors alike.

As part of the broader infrastructure improvement effort, our team is providing high-quality aggregate materials and technical expertise to ensure a smooth, durable finish across all paved surfaces. Motorists are encouraged to follow posted directional signs and cooperate with road personnel throughout the exercise to maintain safe and efficient traffic flow.

This initiative reflects our continued commitment to building stronger, more connected communities across The Bahamas.
